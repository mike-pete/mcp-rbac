- we are building an MCP gateway, users connect to our mcp server with streamable http, and we act as an mcp client - connecting to other http and sse mcp servers
- when using env vars, always access them via the env.ts file ( import { env } from '@/env'
  )
- in typescript prefer type over interface when possible
- in typescript, avoid "any" like the plague
- prefer colocation + locality of behavior
- NEVER user css margin (as margin is a css side effect)! Instead, wrap content in divs and apply padding, or use layout techniques such as flex box or css grid.
- always type things as strictly as possible, use things like discriminated unions when reasonable
- never use "any" to type something in typescript
- don't overengineer things, build the simplest version possible
- always style components for darkmode
- always update env.ts when adding or updating env vars
